# Moving Service Portal
This application provides an administrative backend for managing rates and availability on their moving services

## Running Locally with Docker

Create a .env file

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Make sure the docker port variables in .env are correctly set to an available port on your machine and the mysql database port matches your docker port

```
DOCKER_NGINX_PORT=8099
DOCKER_MYSQL_PORT=3399
...
DB_PORT=3399
```

Run docker-compose to bring up the docker container and start your app

```
docker-compose up
```

This command shell should now display the running instance data. 

In a new shell, get the docker id, and then use that id to bash into the application:

```
docker ps
```

find the id of the docker container named "bcdev/app", replace this id with the one below)

```
docker exec -it b53cfd7ffb21 bash
cd /var/www/html
```

In this new bash window, you can call any composer or artisan commands needed.

Install composer packages and generate a new key for your .env file:

```
composer install
php artisan key:generate
```

At this point, you should be able to see the application homepage by visiting:

```
http://localhost:8090 (Replace with the nginx port set in .env)
```

Then, you can run database migrations and generate fake users:

```
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

**Note**: If the database fails to connect, I've been able to remedy by changing `DB_HOST=localhost` to your correct local IP when running `ipconfig`

You will now be able to login as a test user for each role:

Administrator:
```
email: admin@admin.com
pass: admin
```
